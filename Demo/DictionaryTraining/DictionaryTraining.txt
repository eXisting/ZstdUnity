Managed to find an example of creating dictionary from C# script therefore abandoned bash approach.
Let me know if you would want bash instead.

What is required to create a dictionary:

C#:

1. Create test data with any approach you would like. Example: couple files with characters of random amount
2. Feed them to training method ZDICT_trainFromBuffer
3. Save result of training. This is your dictionary for data set you provided.
4. Initialise dictionary by ZSTD_createCDict and ZSTD_createDDict
4. Whenever you wanna use your dict with compress/decompress you should pass it as parameter and use different method:
ZSTD_compress_usingCDict/ZSTD_compress_usingCDict
5. From this point you will use dictionary as a sample for zstd

Bash:

1. Open console and go use cd Demo/TrainingDictionary
2. Run sh make_test_data.sh
3. Go to ../Assets/Resources and take sample_dict.txt
4. Load bytes of sample_dict.txt and put it in use for your C# scripts from step #3 of C# instructions
