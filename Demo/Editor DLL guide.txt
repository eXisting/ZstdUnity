Editor DLL compilation steps:

MAC:

1. Fetch from zstd repo https://github.com/facebook/zstd
2. Go to build/cmake (Detailed instructions could be found in README.md from this point)
3. Paste this into the console:
cd build/cmake
mkdir builddir
cd builddir
cmake ..
make

4. You should get new folder created under "build/cmake/builddir"
5. Go to build/cmake/builddir and find "libzstd.dylib"
6. Rename to zstd.dylib and paste into unity Assets/Editor/Plugins/OSX folder
7. Make sure to configure zstd with editor only by setting checkmarks under Editor

From now on, Mac is able to work with zstd from editor

Windows:

1. Fetch from zstd repo https://github.com/facebook/zstd
2. Go to build/VS2010 (I used this one)
3. Open zstd.sln via your Visual Studio
4. At the top bar hit Build -> Build solution
5. Go to bin/Debug (or release - depends on your config selected)
6. Find libzstd.dll in one of its subfolders
7. Paste it into Unity Assets/Editor/Plugins/x86-64 folder and rename to zstd.dll
8. Make sure to configure zstd with editor only by setting checkmarks under Editor
